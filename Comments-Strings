Well done all around!  Good conversion from integers to Strings.
One issue: your getMinIndex and getMaxIndex don't work properly - the min and max variables aren't updated
the way that you think they are, because you have indentation but not { braces } on the if statement.

Other than that one thing, this is good.
Please be sure you test your code and make sure it gives the correct answer in many different situations!
